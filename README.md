🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms – Daily Progress Tracker
Welcome to our DSA Practice Repository — a continuously evolving collection of coding problems and solutions.
Our goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, maintain consistent GitHub activity, and document our growth through daily commits.

🧩 About the Repository
This repo contains solutions to DSA problems solved using:

C++ (primary language)
Occasionally Python / JavaScript for comparison
Each solution is written with clean code, time and space complexity, and comments explaining the approach
⚙️ How We Work
🗓 Daily Goal: Solve at least 1 problem and push the solution.
🧠 Approach: Focus on logic, dry runs, and edge cases.
📈 Progress Tracking: Continuous commits to maintain a consistent GitHub contribution graph.
🔍 Code Quality: Each solution includes:
Problem statement (short summary)
Approach / logic explanation
Time & space complexity analysis
Example test cases
🧠 Topics Covered
✔️ Arrays
✔️ Strings
✔️ Linked Lists
✔️ Stacks & Queues
✔️ Trees & Binary Search Trees
✔️ Heaps & Priority Queues
✔️ Graphs
✔️ Recursion & Backtracking
✔️ Searching & Sorting
✔️ Dynamic Programming (optional later)
